/*
 * (Palindrome integer)
 * 
 * Write the methods with the following headers:
 * 
 *      // Return the reversal of an integer, e.g./ reverse(456) returns 654.
 *      public static int reverse(int number)
 * 
 *      // Return true if number is a palindrome
 *      public static boolean isPalindrome(int number)
 * 
 * Use the reverse method to implement isPalindrome. A number is a palindrome is its reversal
 * is the same as itself. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and
 * reports whether the integer is a palindrome.
