/*
 * (Financial Application: Compute CD Value)
 * 
 * Suppose you put $10,000 into a CD with an annual percentage yield of 5.75%. After one month, the CD is worth
 * 
 *              10000 + 10000 * 5.75 / 1200 = 100047.92
 * 
 * After two months, the CD is worth
 * 
 *              10047.91 + 10047.91 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10096.06
 * 
 * After three months, the CD is worth
 * 
 *              10096.06 + 10096.06 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10144.44
 * 
 * and so on.
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts that user to enter an amount (e.g./ 10000), the  annual percentage yield (e.g., 5.75), and the number
 * of months (e.g., 18) and displays a table as presented in the sample run.
 * 
 *      Enter the initial deposit amount: 10000
 *      Enter the annual percentage yield: 5.75
 *      Enter maturity period (number of months): 18
 * 
 *      Month       CD Value
 *      1           10047.92
 *      2           10096.06
 *      ...
 *      17          10846.57
 *      18          10898.54
