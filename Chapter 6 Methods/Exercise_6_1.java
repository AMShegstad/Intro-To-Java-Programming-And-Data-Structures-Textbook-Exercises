/*
 * (Math: pentagonal numbers)
 * 
 * A pentagonal number is defined as n(3n-1)/2 for n = 1, 2, ..., and so on. Therefore, the first
 * few numbera are 1, 5, 12, 22, ... . Write a method with the following header that returns a 
 * pentagonal number:
 * 
 *      public static int getPantagonalNumber(int n)
 * 
 * For example, getPentagonalNumber(1) returns 1 and getPentagonalNumber(2) returns 5. Write a test
 * program that uses this method to display the first 100 pentagonal numbers with 10 numbers on each
 * line. Use %7d format to display each number.
