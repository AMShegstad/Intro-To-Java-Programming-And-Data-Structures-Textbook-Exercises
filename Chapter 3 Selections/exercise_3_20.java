/*
 * (Science: Wind-chill temperature) Programming Exercise 2.17 gives a formula to compute
 * the wind-chil temperature. The formula is valid for temperatures in the range between
 * -58F and 41F and wind-speed greater than or equal to 2. Write a program that prompts 
 * the user to enter a temperature and a wind speed. The program displays the wind-chill
 * temperature if the input is valid; otherwise, it displays a message indicating whether
 * the temperature and/or wind-speed is invalid.
