# Intro-To-Java-Programming-And-Data-Structures-Textbook-Exercises
Working through all relevant exercises in the textbook "Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures" by Y Daniel Liang.
<br>

I didn't work through all of these tasks when I was studying the textbook in school, but I thought it'd be good practice to work through the entire collection of exercises.
<br>

The goal is to complete the entire textbook before Summer of 2025. Wish me luck!
