/*
 * (Computer architecture: bit-level operations)
 * 
 * A short value is stored in 16 bits. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a short
 * integer and displays the 16 bits for the integer. Here are some sample runs:
 * 
 * Enter an integer: 5
 * The bits are 0000000000000101
 * 
 * Enter an integer: -5
 * The bits are 1111111111111011
 * 
 * (HINT: You need to use the bitwise right shift operator (>>) and the bitwise AND
 * operator (&), which are covered in Appendix G, Bitwise Operations.)
