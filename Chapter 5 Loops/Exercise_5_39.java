/*
 * (Financial Application: Find the sales amount) 
 * 
 * You have just started a sales job in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission.
 * The base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission rate:
 * 
 *      Sales Amount                              Commission Rate
 *      ---------------------------------------------------------
 *      $0.01 - $5,000                                   8%
 *      $5,000.01 - $10,000                             10%
 *      $10,000.01 and above                            12%
 * 
 * Note this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the next $5,000 is at 10%, and the rest
 * is at 12%. If the sales amount is $25,000, the commission is $5,000 * 8 + $5,000 * 10 + $15,000 * 12 = 2,700.
 * Your goal is to earn $30,000 a year. Write a program that finds out the minimum number of sales you have to 
 * generate in order to make $30,000.
